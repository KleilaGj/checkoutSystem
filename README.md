# checkoutSystem
**Brief**
Implement the code for a basket that calculates the total price of a number of items. 
Item A and B are multipriced (as shown below), so the total price must reflect this.

Item	Unit Price (pence)

A	50	3 for 130

B	30	2 for 45

C	20	

D	15

**Goal**
My goal was to build a checkout system that accepted price discounts as outlined in the brief


**Guidance**
The app has a series of methods proving that products can be added to the basket and the correct final price will include the discounts appropriate to the item and item quantity.


**Future Improvements**
Though the core functionality is there, given more time I would have made the console app accept user interaction:
-     User would be able to add items
-     View basket
-     View basket total price
-     Add more than one of the same item to the basket at once instead of adding the item to basket several times
-     Clear basket

I would also look to put all of my data objects in a separate file and all of my functions in a separate file and then import them into the main.js file.


Rough time estimate to complete task:
